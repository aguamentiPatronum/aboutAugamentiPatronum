### Hi, I'm Britt 👋  

I’m a data scientist and engineer focused on **explainability, fairness, and human-centered analytics**.  
I build transparent, interactive systems that make complex models and datasets interpretable — for researchers, analysts, and decision-makers alike.

---

#### 🧠 Focus Areas
- Machine Learning Interpretability & Fairness  
- Data Visualization & Storytelling for Decision Support  
- Scalable, Reproducible Analytics Pipelines (pandas, Dask, dbt)  
- Model Risk Documentation & Human-AI Trust  

---

#### ⚙️ Technical Stack
Python • pandas • NumPy • scikit-learn • PyTorch  
Plotly Dash • React • Docker • MongoDB • Linux/macOS • Git  
APIs • Data Storytelling • CI/CD fundamentals  

---

#### 🧩 What I Value
- **Clarity over complexity** — code, models, and visualizations should invite exploration.  
- **Empowering users** — the best tools make insights accessible to everyone, not just experts.  
- **Reproducibility and integrity** — from experiments to analytics pipelines, transparency builds trust.
